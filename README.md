## 🎯 GitHub Pages Deployment

### How It Works

1. **vite.config.ts** sets `base: "/Meet-e-Store/"`
2. **src/App.jsx** uses `BrowserRouter basename="/Meet-e-Store"`
3. **package.json** has `deploy` script that uses `gh-pages`
4. Running `npm run deploy` builds and pushes to `gh-pages` branch
5. GitHub automatically serves from `https://meet123-coder.github.io/Meet-e-Store/`
